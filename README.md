I miss the days when I used to go to the arcade hall and play console games with my friends . Many old games are interesting, but ,as time goes by
we can't play them together any more.I hope I(we) can change old games to online games.

My idea is :

Actual input device (local simulator) - > server - > virtual input device layer - > local simulator

(similar to StarCraft and Warcraft online mode)

I don't know if I can fulfill this wish in my lifetime, anyway,I start this project first.
